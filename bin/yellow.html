					<h1>Yellow | Emotional </h1>
					 <p> <strong> Positive:</strong> Optimism, confidence, self-esteem, extraversion, emotional strength, friendliness, creativity. 
					<p> <strong> Negative:</strong> Irrationality, fear, emotional fragility, depression, anxiety, suicide.

					<p>The yellow wavelength is relatively long and essentially stimulating. In this case the stimulus is emotional, therefore yellow is the strongest colour, psychologically. The right yellow will lift our spirits and our self-esteem; it is the colour of confidence and optimism. Too much of it, or the wrong tone in relation to the other tones in a colour scheme, can cause self-esteem to plummet, giving rise to fear and anxiety. Our "yellow streak" can surface. </p>

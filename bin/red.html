					<h1>Red Colour | Physical</h1>

					<p><strong>Positive:</strong> Physical courage, strength, warmth, energy, basic survival, 'fight or flight', stimulation, masculinity, excitement. </p>
					
					<p> <strong>Negative:</strong> Defiance, aggression, visual impact, strain.</p>

					<p>Being the longest wavelength, red is a powerful colour. Although not technically the most visible, it has the property of appearing to be nearer than it is and therefore it grabs our attention first. Hence its effectiveness in traffic lights the world over. Its effect is physical; it stimulates us and raises the pulse rate, giving the impression that time is passing faster than it is. It relates to the masculine principle and can activate the "fight or flight" instinct. Red is strong, and very basic. Pure red is the simplest colour, with no subtlety. It is stimulating and lively, very friendly. At the same time, it can be perceived as demanding and aggressive.</p>
